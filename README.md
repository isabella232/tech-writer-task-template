# Welcome to the Prisma Technical Writer assignment

We're extensively using GitHub and Markdown for collaborating our docs.
This assignment will hopefully help you get a glimpse at what part of your day to day will involve.

## Task

Your goal is to create a tutorial about **database seeding for Node.js developers who work with PostgreSQL databases**.
The tutorial should include:
 * A conceptual overview of database seeding, including when and why to use it
 * A working example of a seeding script using any Node.js Postgres client, such as [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), or anything else you feel comfortable with **except Prisma** (we want to reduce potential bias in our evaluation)
 * Instructions on how to use the example and run it
 * Pros and cons of the approach and conclusion

## Format

You should create your own GitHub repository using this one as a template, and invite @mhwelander and @thebiglabasky to review it once you're done.
Once we're in, we would like to be able to clone the repository, navigate to your guide to go through it, and run the example that will be part of it.

## Material available in this template repository

 * A `package.json` and `src/main.js` files that are ready to run
 * A `schema.sql` file you can use to create a basic structure with a single table called "Translations" for your seeding example
 * A `guide.md` meant to contain the guide
 
 Note: feel free to scratch the contents of this README.md file in your own repository!
